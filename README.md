# Recognizing-handwritten-devanagari-numerals
A machine learning model to recognize devanagari numerals
Project Overview
This project involves the development and implementation of a handwritten Devanagari numeral recognition system using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The objective is to accurately recognize and classify handwritten Devanagari numerals for diverse applications.

Project Components
Data Collection: A dataset consisting of handwritten Devanagari numerals is collected for training and testing the recognition model.

Data Preprocessing: The collected images are preprocessed using techniques like grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, resizing, and thresholding. The preprocessed images are then converted into a format suitable for training the recognition model.

Model Training: Multiple machine learning and deep learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Ne Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest are employed for training and evaluating the recognition model.

Model Evaluation: The trained models are evaluated for accuracy and performance using test data and various evaluation metrics like accuracy score and confusion matrix.

Real-time Prediction: Real-time prediction functionality is implemented, where the trained model can predict the handwritten Devanagari numerals in real time using a webcam or any input source.

File Structure
The project directory contains the following key files and directories:

Source Code: Python scripts containing the implementation of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and real-time prediction functionalities.
Datasets: Contains the dataset of handwritten Devanagari numerals used for training and testing.
Model: Stores the trained recognition model for real-time prediction.
